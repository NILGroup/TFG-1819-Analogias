\chapter*{Abstract}

Today, a 1\% of spanish population suffers from some kind of mental disability. It is very difficult for these people to perform simple tasks such as reading a book or doing groceries due to their struggles with the understanding of some day to day concepts. The easiest solution would be to look for words in a dictionary but this task is difficult for these people because the definitions and concepts used there are complex and hard to understand.

In order to help this people with their inhability to understand certain words, we have developed a web application in which they can relate this difficult words with easier words they know and understand. This was accomplished by using certain similes and metaphores related to those words. The fact that it is a web application makes it easy to use it by everyone with an internet connection.

We desired to focus on the user, so we design an app that trust on expert opinion and adapts itself to their needs.

This application is composed by a few web services that can obtain related words, similes and metaphores. Also, in order to  make it easier for the user, we have implemented two more web services: one of them finds pictograms and the other one finds examples and description for the word they look for.

The application has been tested by targeted users. After been tested by this users, we have concluded that this application is useful for people who have mild disabilities but we need to keep working to make it useful for people with severe disability.
